Instructions
You must extract and verify detailed, structured project data from multiple credible public sources. The goal is not only to fill each field but to ensure completeness, traceability, and historical coverage.

Posts
| Date | Title / Text | Status | Source | Verification Date | |------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------| | 2025-01-20 | "First concert held at GEM featuring soprano Fatma Said and orchestra" | 🆕 | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Egyptian_Museum | 2025-05-26 | | 2025-03-17 | "Egypt finalises plans for museum opening ceremony" | 🆕 | https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/... | 2025-05-26 | | 2025-04-07 | "Grand Egyptian Museum to officially open on July 3, 2025" | 🆕 | https://wildhunt.org/... | 2025-05-26 |

Quality Guidelines
✅ Comprehensiveness:
Don’t stop at one source—triangulate multiple references and build a full project history.

✅ Coverage:
For long-running projects, include historical milestones and early development data alongside recent updates.

✅ Traceability:
Every value must be traceable via an active source link. Prioritize: - Official project websites - Government and regulatory portals - Developer/contractor press rooms - Reputable industry media (MEED, Reuters, Zawya, The National, etc.)

✅ Detail Orientation:
Avoid placeholders or vague generalizations. Use specific quantities, roles, dates, and labels.

✅ New Data Identification:
If any values are completely new or previously unrecorded in our system, clearly mark them with the 🆕 status.

If you cannot verify a field confidently, leave the value blank, mark the status as ❓, and add a short reason in the notes.

This format ensures a fully auditable and research-grade entry suitable for executive review and CRM onboarding.
